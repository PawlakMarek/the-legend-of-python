# The Legend of Python

This repository showcases my progress in the "The Legend of Python" course from [codedex.io](https://codedex.io). The course covers various fundamental and advanced topics in Python programming, and this repository contains the exercises and projects I have completed as part of the course.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on different aspects of Python programming:

- **hello_world/**: Basic Python scripts to get started with programming.
  - `hello_world.py`
  - `initials.py`
  - `letter.py`
  - `pattern.py`
- **variables/**: Contains scripts demonstrating variable usage and operations.
  - `bmi.py`
  - `currency.py`
  - `hypotenuse.py`
  - `temperature.py`
- **control_flow/**: Contains scripts demonstrating control flow concepts such as conditionals and loops.
  - `coin_flip.py`
  - `grades.py`
  - `magic8.py`
  - `ph_levels.py`
  - `sorting_hat.py`
  - `the_cyclone.py`
- **loops/**: Contains scripts demonstrating loop constructs in Python.
  - `99_bottles.py`
  - `detention.py`
  - `enter_pin.py`
  - `fizz_buzz.py`
  - `guess.py`
- **checkpoint/**: Contains the `rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.py` game implementation.
- **lists/**
- **functions/**
- **classes_and_objects/**
- **modules/**

## Notable Scripts

- **[checkpoint/rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.py](checkpoint/rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.py)**: A game implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
- **[control_flow/sorting_hat.py](control_flow/sorting_hat.py)**: A script that sorts users into Hogwarts houses based on their answers to a series of questions.
- **[control_flow/the_cyclone.py](control_flow/the_cyclone.py)**: A script that determines if a user can ride a roller coaster based on their height and credits.
- **[control_flow/magic8.py](control_flow/magic8.py)**: A Magic 8 Ball simulation that provides random answers to user questions.
- **[loops/fizz_buzz.py](loops/fizz_buzz.py)**: A classic FizzBuzz implementation using loops and conditionals.

## Getting Started

To run any of the scripts, simply navigate to the directory containing the script and execute it using Python. For example:

```sh
cd control_flow
python sorting_hat.py

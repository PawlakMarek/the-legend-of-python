### Instructions
# A bucket list is a number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime.
#
# Create a bucket_list.py program with your own unique bucket list.
#
# First, create a things_to_do list, and add things you want to do in your lifetime.
#
# For example:
#
# things_to_do = [
#   '🚀 Create the dopest learn to code platform ever.',
#   '⛰️ Hike the Pacific Crest Trail.',
#   '🏡 Build an A-frame house and raise some goats.',
#   '🌏 Live somewhere in Asia for a year.',
#   '🎸 Release an album.',
#   '📝 Write a book.',
#   '🏆 Reach 100k subscribers on YouTube.',
#   '🚐 Road trip with the fam.',
#   '🍳 Open a cozy diner upstate.',
#   '👴🏻 Grow old with no regrets.'
# ]
#
# Now, iterate over the list and print everything out.
#
# Lastly, to keep yourself accountable, take a screenshot of your program and post your bucket list to Twitter by clicking the icon below.
#
# The days are long but the years are short; from the whole Codédex team, we hope you accomplish all of your wildest dreams!
